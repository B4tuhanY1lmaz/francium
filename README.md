## Environment Variables

To run this project, you have to have an .env file like tthe one below.
```bash
## Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"  

## NextAuth  
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<secret_you_generate>
NEXTAUTH_URL=<domain_of_your_application>
AdminMail=<your_email>

DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=

# Github

```
- You need to specify your email address on this file to mark yourself as owner. Otherwise you won't be able to access the dashboard of this application.
- You need to generate an secret for Nextauth to generate session tokens, you can get one by using the `openssl rand -base64 32` command.
- You also need to specify the domain of application, otherwise you could have problems with auth providers.

You can get your client id and secrets from links below:
- [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- [Google](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
- [Github](https://github.com/settings/apps)

If you've disabled an auth provider inside the config file, you can ignore it.
